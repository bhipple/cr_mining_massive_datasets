Map Reduce
----------
Map(k, v) -> <k', v'>*
    One Map call for every (k,v) input pair
    Word count example:
        (k,v) is (document name, document contents)
        It then emits to <word, 1> for every word in the document
    5 word sequence:
        Same (k,v)
    Emits <5 word sequence, 1> from document
Reduce(k', <v'>*) -> (k', <v''>*)
    One Reduce call per unique key k'
    All values v' with the same key k' are reduced together to form the new pair <k', v''>*
    Word count example:
        For each key k', count the number of v' values associated with it.
